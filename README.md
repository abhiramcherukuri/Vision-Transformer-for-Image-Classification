# Vision-Transformer-for-Image-Classification
The objective of an artificial intelligence (AI) vision transformer project is to develop a new and improved method for computer vision tasks. The goal is to create a model that can learn complex patterns in images and use this knowledge to perform tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
